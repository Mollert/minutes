				<p>Proof of notice was confirmed by AMS agent, Melissa Dickson. Oakley then welcomed all homeowners who were present, gave a brief overview of the year's accomplishments and welcomed new homeowners, Jackie Plott and the Frye's, Veronica and Walt. Sally was also thanked for her service as a board member.</p>
				<p>Under new business, the minutes from the 2020 Annual meeting were approved.</p>
				<p>Tom Reis presented the proposed budget for 2022. Ballots and notification were sent out prior to the meeting. Since voting for this issue was by write-in ballot, Melissa announced the budget passed 15 yes to 1 abstention.</p>
				<p>the third item under new business was the election of directors. There were three open seats and four candidates. Again, write-in ballots were required which were received earlier via postal and email. Fifteen ballots were cast. The results were announced by Melissa as follows as the directors serving two-year terms: Mollert, Oakley and Thompson.</p>
				<p>It was announced that the bylaws require that officers must also be elected to serve the year as follow: President, Vice-president, Secretary and Treasurer. Since these also require write-in voting, a notice and ballots will be sent out in January.</p>
				<p>The president also announced a proposed bylaws change. This would be to limit terms a director may serve to two consecutive two-year terms. a bylaws change requires a vote by the homeowners and will be conducted via write-in in January.</p>
				<p>Per his request at the November HOA meeting, David Mollert requested to have a landscape proposal he prepared entered into the Annual meeting. The board approved this under the condition that it be distributed in advance and that no discussion would be considered. The board thanked David and assured him thy would take it up at their January meeting. a copy of that proposal is attached to these minutes.</p>
				<p>Under other business, on behalf of the landscape committee, Sally Almason gave a power point presentation outlining the items under consideration to be undertaken in the year 2022. She and Leslie Mackinson were thanked for their hard work in putting this together.</p>
				<p>Oakley again thanked the homeowners who had participated in the process and called for adjournment.</p>
